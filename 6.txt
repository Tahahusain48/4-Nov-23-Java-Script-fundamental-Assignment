
Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Clear identifiers make it easier for developers to understand the purpose of variables, reducing cognitive load and contributing to better code quality. Let's explore the importance with an example:
Here's an example with unclear variable names:
let a = "123 Main St";
let b = "Cityville";
let c = "Countryland";
let d = "98765";

Now, let's use meaningful and descriptive variable names:
let streetAddress = "123 Main St";
let city = "Cityville";
let country = "Countryland";
let postalCode = "98765";
