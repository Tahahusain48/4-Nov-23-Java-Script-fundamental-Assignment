
Comments in JavaScript are essential for documenting code, providing explanations, and making the code more understandable for developers. They serve as non-executable text that is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
// This is a single-line comment
let firstName = "John";  // Variable storing the first name
let lastName = "Doe";    // Variable storing the last name

/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span multiple lines
  Used for longer explanations or comments
*/

let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;

/*
  Calculate the sum of num1 and num2
  and store it in the result variable
*/
let result = num1 + num2;

// Display the result in the console
console.log("Sum:", result);
