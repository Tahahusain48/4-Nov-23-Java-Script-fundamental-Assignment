-Unary Operators:
let x = 5;
let y = -x;  // Unary negation, y is now -5
Unary plus + (converts an operand to a number)
Unary negation - (negates the operand)

-Binary Operators:
let a = 5;
let b = 2;
let sum = a + b;  // Binary addition, sum is now 7

let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
